            <p>Lead Instructor, Mathnasium of Lake Mary:    Feb 2020 - August 2023 <br>
As a lead instructor, I oversaw training for other instructors, worked with many different students, and resolved conflicts with parents.</p>
            <p>High School Math Teacher, Academic Community Enrichment: August 2023 - May 2025 <br>
I developed a curriculum and taught high school math ranging from Pre-Algebra to Pre-Calculus. Alongside math, I also taught introductory programming in Python.</p>
            <p>Undergraduate TA Embedded Systems, UCF: August 2023 - August 2024 <br>
As an undergraduate teaching assistant, I ran the embedded systems labs. This involved helping students program MSP430, read documentation, and debug C code.</p>
            <p>Graduate TA Systems Software, UCF: August 2025 - Current <br>
As a graduate teaching assistant, I run lab help sections to provide extra insight from class, help debug C and C++ code, and help with the Antlr tool chain. </p>
            
            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <a /href="https://github.com/DonovanReynolds/ArduScript">Arduscript</a>
            <p>This project is a intended as a teaching compiler to be used as an introduction to programming with embedded systems. This is a custom language that I created intended to use python like features that compiles into Arduino IDE code that can then be flashed onto any system that is supported. The language is very basic as its intention is only introduction to embedded systems</p>

            <p>This project was the senior design showcase winner at spring UCF 2024. My contribution to this project was writing all of the embedded software that interfaced the different sensors using the ATMega328PB and working with the image recognition software being run on the Jetson Nano.</p>
